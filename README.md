# Golden Items
A mod which adds powerful but expensive variants of items to the game.

## Golden Shop
The Golden Shop is a module that has a configurable chance of appearing in the shop after a level. You'll know whether or not it spawns based on the gold door that replaces the bathroom. In here is where any potential items will be stocked.

## Gold Items
Gold items are the primary feature of this mod. Golden items are expensive variants of the standard items, that will automatically recharge for free after a minute of not being used (configurable). These items, when recharging, will regain battery at a rate of 5%/second (also configurable).

## Gold Health Packs
Gold health packs are permanent variants of health packs. You can use them in one level, and the next level they will be recharged, ready for you to use again.

## Gold Upgrade
The Gold Upgrade grants the user +1 to all vanilla upgrades. This has a configurable setting to apply to all users in a lobby.

### Notes and Issues
- This is untested for multiplayer. It should work but no guarantees. I'll adjust this after testing.
- The Zero Gravity Orb is disabled because of shader issues. I'll fix that when I can.
- The mod is designed for late game, so the prices are incredibly high. You can adjust this in the config.
